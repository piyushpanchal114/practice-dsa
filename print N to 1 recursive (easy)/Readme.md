## Problem Statement

Suggest Edit

#### You are given an integer _**‘n’**_.

#### Your task is to return an array containing integers from ‘n’ to ‘1’ (in decreasing order) without using loops.

##### Note:

    In the output, you will see the array returned by you.

##### Example:

    Input: ‘n’ = 5

    Output: 5 4 3 2 1

    Explanation: An array containing integers from ‘n’ to ‘1’ is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

##### Input Format

    The first line contains one integer, ‘n’, denoting the integer.

##### Output format:

    Return the array as described above.

##### Note:-

    You don't need to print anything. Just implement the given function.

##### Sample Input 1:

    5

##### Sample Output 1 :

    5 4 3 2 1

##### Explanation Of Sample Input 1:

    Input: ‘n’ = 5

    Output: 5 4 3 2 1

    Explanation: An array containing integers from ‘5’ to ‘1’ is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

##### Sample Input 2:

    2

##### Sample Output 2:

    2 1

##### Explanation Of Sample Input 2:

    Input: ‘n’ = 2

    Output: 2 1

    Explanation: An array containing integers from ‘2’ to ‘1’ is [2, 1].

##### Expected Time Complexity:

    The expected time complexity is O(n), where 'n' is the given integer.

##### Expected Space Complexity:

    The expected space complexity is O(n), where 'n' is the given integer.

##### Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 10^4

    Time Limit: 1-sec
