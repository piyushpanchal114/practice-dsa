**Armstrong Number**

## Problem Statement

Suggest Edit

#### You are given an integer _**'n'**_.

#### Return _**'true'**_ if 'n' is an Armstrong number, and _**'false'**_ otherwise.

##### Note:

    An Armstrong number is a number (with 'k' digits) such that the sum of its digits raised to 'kth' power is equal to the number itself. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371.

##### Example:

    Input: 'n' = 1634

    Output: true

    Explanation:
    1634 is an Armstrong number, as 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1634

##### Input Format :

    The first line of the input contains an integer 'n'.

##### Output Format :

    Return 'true' or 'false' as mentioned in the problem statement.

##### Note

    You don't need to print anything, just implement the given function. "true" will be printed if the returned value is a boolean 'true' and "false" otherwise.

##### Sample Input 1 :

    1

##### Sample Output 1 :

    true

##### Explanation of Sample Input 1 :

    1 is an Armstrong number as, 1^1 = 1.

##### Sample Input 2 :

    103

##### Sample Output 2 :

    false

##### Expected Time Complexity:

    Try to solve this in O(log(n)).

##### Constraints:
