## Problem Statement

Suggest Edit

#### You are given two integers _**'n'**_, and _**'m'**_.

#### Calculate _**'gcd(n,m)'**_, without using library functions.

##### Note:

    The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers 'n' and 'm' is the largest positive number that divides both 'n' and 'm' without leaving a remainder.

##### Example:

    Input: 'n' = 6, 'm' = 4

    Output: 2

    Explanation:
    Here, gcd(4,6) = 2, because 2 is the largest positive integer that divides both 4 and 6.

##### Input format:

    The first line of input contains two integers ‘n’ and 'm'.

##### Output Format:

    Return an integer as described in the problem statement.

##### Note

    You don’t need to print anything, it has already been taken care of, just complete the given function.

##### Sample Input 1:

    9 6

##### Sample Output 1:

    3

##### Explanation of sample output 1:

    gcd(6,9) is 3, as 3 is the largest positive integer that divides both 6 and 9.

##### Sample Input 2:

    2 5

##### Sample Output 2:

    1

##### Expected Time Complexity:

    Try to solve this in O(log(n))

##### Constraints:

    0 <= ‘n’ <= 10^5

    Time Limit: 1 sec
