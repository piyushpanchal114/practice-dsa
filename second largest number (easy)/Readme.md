**Second Largest Number**

## Problem Statement

Suggest Edit

#### You have been given an array _**‘a’**_ of _**‘n’**_ unique non-negative integers.You have to find the second largest and second smallest element from the array.

#### Your task is to return two elements (second largest and second smallest) as another array of size 2.

##### Example :

    Input: ‘n’ = 5, ‘a’ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    Output: [4, 2]

    The second largest element after 5 is 4, and the second smallest element after 1 is 2.

##### Input Format:

    The first line will contain the integer ‘n’, the number of elements in the array ‘a’, and the next line will contain the ‘n’ spaced integers in the array elements.

##### Output Format:

    Print two elements, the second largest and the second smallest element, from the array.

##### Note:

    You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.

##### Sample Input 1 :

    4
    3 4 5 2

##### Sample Output 1 :

    4 3

##### Explanation For Sample Input 1 :

    The second largest element after 5 is 4 only, and the second smallest element after 2 is 3.

##### Sample Input 2 :

    5
    4 5 3 6 7

##### Sample Output 2 :

    6 4

##### Expected Time Complexity:

    O( N ), Where ‘N’ is the size of an input array ‘a’.

##### Constraints:

    2 ≤ 'n' ≤ 10^5
    0 ≤ 'a'[i] ≤ 10^9
