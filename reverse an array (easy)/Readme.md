**Reverse an Array**

## Problem Statement

Suggest Edit

#### Given an array _**'arr'**_ of size _**'n'**_.

#### Return an array with all the elements placed in reverse order.

##### Note:

    You donâ€™t need to print anything. Just implement the given function.

##### Example:

    Input: n = 6, arr = [5, 7, 8, 1, 6, 3]

    Output: [3, 6, 1, 8, 7, 5]

    Explanation: After reversing the array, it looks like this [3, 6, 1, 8, 7, 5].

##### Input Format:

    The first line contains an integer n, the size of the array
    The second line contains n integers, the array.

##### Output format:

    Return the reversed array.

##### Sample Input 1:

    8
    3 1 1 7 4 2 6 11

##### Sample Output 1:

    11 6 2 4 7 1 1 3

##### Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :

    After reversing the array, it looks like this [11, 6, 2, 4, 7, 1, 1, 3].

##### Sample Input 2:

    4
    8 1 3 2

##### Sample Output 2:

    2 3 1 8

##### Explanation Of Sample Input 2 :

    After reversing the array, it looks like this [2, 3, 1, 8].

##### Expected time complexity

    The expected time complexity is O(n).

##### Constraints:

    1 <= 'n' <= 10^6
    -10^9 <= 'arr[i]' <=10^9
